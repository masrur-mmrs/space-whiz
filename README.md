# ☀️ SpaceWhizz – Stellar Stories

SpaceWhizz is an educational web app designed for kids to learn about **space weather** through storytelling, videos, and interactive quizzes.  
Built for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 under the *Stellar Stories* category.

---

## 📖 Overview
SpaceWhizz transforms the invisible science of **solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and auroras** into kid-friendly adventures.  
Children progress through **9 story-driven adventures**, each with 3 short missions.  
After each mission, they complete a fun quiz to unlock the next level.  
SpaceWhizz is built like a storybook adventure. Kids begin with Meet the Sun ☀️ — a friendly guide to the star at the center of our solar system. From there, they unlock a journey of nine adventures, each containing three short missions.
Every adventure is themed around a real-world impact of space weather. In Dance of Lights 🌌, kids discover the beauty of auroras. In The Lost Tractor 🚜, they learn how GPS signals affect farmers. In The Silent Sky ✈️, they explore why pilots sometimes lose communication. Later, in The Blackout City ⚡️, they see how solar storms can even knock out electricity.
After each animated video, kids solve a short quiz challenge. Passing the quiz unlocks the next mission — making learning feel like play, while reinforcing key concepts. As they progress, they collect badges, building a sense of achievement.
And here’s the exciting part: our Sun-Watch feature connects directly to **NASA’s CCMC DONKI API**. This means children don’t just learn about solar flares in theory — they see real flare events from the last 30 days, presented in kid-friendly cards with simple icons and animations. It’s like watching the Sun tell its story in real time.
SpaceWhizz blends storytelling, play, and NASA data into one seamless experience — transforming space weather from abstract science into a living adventure that children can explore step by step.”


Key Features:
- 🎬 Short animated videos powered by `next-video` and **Mux streaming**  
- 🌀 Smooth storytelling animations with **Motion** (`motion.div`)  
- 📡 Real-time solar flare feed via NASA **CCMC DONKI API** (Sun-Watch feature)  
- 🏅 Gamification with badges, progression, and unlockable adventures

## ❓ Problem Statement – *Stellar Stories*
Space weather is powerful but **invisible and often forgotten**.  
Kids rarely know how solar storms affect:
- 🚜 Farmers who depend on GPS  
- ✈️ Pilots who rely on communication signals  
- 🧑‍🚀 Astronauts exposed to radiation  
- ⚡ Entire cities dependent on power grids  

When children don’t see or understand these forces, they miss both the **wonder** and the **importance** of space weather.  
The *Stellar Stories* challenge calls for creative ways to make this science **engaging, visible, and meaningful**.
